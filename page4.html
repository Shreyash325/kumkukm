    <h2>Our Journey Continues...</h2>
    <p>
      I’ll never forget 27 January when you wore that beautiful saree just for me. You looked like a true goddess, more stunning than I ever imagined. Holding you close, sharing our first real kiss, even if we were unsure, was the most perfect moment because it was ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, when you surprised me with a teddy bear, chocolates, and halwa—no words can express how loved I felt. Even though I didn’t bring anything for you, you showered me with unconditional love. That’s you, my Kumkum, my selfless, caring, and perfect soulmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every memory, from sharing coffee and kachoris to the songs and laughter, lives in my heart forever. You are, and always will be, my queen, my soulmate, and my "wifey" for life.
