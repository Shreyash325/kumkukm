    <h2>Happy Birthday, Mera Bccha, Meri Jaan...</h2>
    <p>
      My Kumkum, today we celebrate the most beautiful soul who has filled my life with love, joy, and memories that I'll cherish forever. You’re my heart, my breath, my everything, and I can't imagine a single day without you. Even though life may keep us apart, you'll always be my soulmate, bound forever in my heart.

      Our first meeting on Instagram feels like a blessing from above. Little did I know that I was about to meet someone who would understand me, laugh with me, console me, and become my whole world. From our late-night talks to those moments of pure laughter, you’ve been my light in every dark time.

      On our first meeting on 12 January 2024, you looked radiant in that pink sweater, reddish jacket, and lion-fur hat. You hugged me, and though I felt shy, I knew my heart had found its home. When we held hands in the auto and you gave me that precious kiss, I felt our souls connect in a way words could never express.
